// lockOffset is the byte the exclusive range lock covers: far past
// everything this package writes, because the holder record lives at
// offset 0 and a Windows byte-range lock is *enforced*, not advisory.
//
// That difference is the whole reason this constant exists. On Unix a
// flock is a hint: the kernel keeps other processes out of the lock but
// they can still read the file, so the record written by the holder is
// readable by exactly the process trying to ask who holds it. Locking
// offset 0 on Windows instead makes every read of the record fail with
// ERROR_LOCK_VIOLATION — the busy path then reported "held by another
// live process" with an empty holder, and a second handle in the same
// process stopped being recognized as ours. Nothing caught it until the
// Windows lane ran this package (the darwin/linux runs cannot: same
// lock, advisory semantics).
//
// 1 GiB is arbitrary and deliberate: no record this package writes gets
// near it, and it stays inside the low 32 bits of the OVERLAPPED offset
// so the byte arithmetic is obvious.
