// Package pathsafe centralizes the containment rule: "is this path the
// root or a descendant of it?". It exists because the same check was
// re-implemented across the tree with different strengths — a viewer
// resolving a link, a skill install unpacking a repo-supplied subpath,
// a media attachment rendered against the workspace — and a missing
// symlink pass in any one of them is a path-escape bug.
//
// Two strengths are offered, and callers must pick deliberately:
//
//   - Within / Rel / ResolveUnder judge the paths as given, lexically.
//     They are the right choice when the path has already been
//     resolved, or when the caller owns the resolution step.
//   - RealWithin / RealDir resolve symlinks first. Use them when an
//     untrusted path is compared against a root: without the symlink
//     pass, a link inside the root can point outside it.
//
// The package owns no I/O policy. Which roots exist, what is readable,
// and what happens on a violation stay with the caller.
